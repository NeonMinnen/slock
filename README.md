# slock
My slock build.

Patches include 
- [DWM Logo](https://tools.suckless.org/slock/patches/dwmlogo/) 
- [Control Key Clear](https://tools.suckless.org/slock/patches/control-clear/) (Wake with control key, and doesn't count as a failed key register.)
- [Failure Command](https://tools.suckless.org/slock/patches/failure-command/) (Runs command after "x" number of failed login attempts.)
